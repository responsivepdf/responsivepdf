	This notification is broadcast before a document is printed, 
	and before any marks are made on the first page. When printing 
	to a PostScript printer, printing commands can also be sent 
	that are placed on the page before any other marks. For 
	example, a <code>setpagedevice</code> operator could be placed in the 
	print stream. 
	@param doc The document that is about to be printed. 
	@param stm The PostScript print stream used when printing to 
	a PostScript printer, and <code>NULL</code> when printing to a non-PostScript 
	printer. When printing to a PostScript printer, clients 
	can write printing commands into <code>stm</code> (using <code>ASStmWrite()</code>) 
	to add marks to pages before any other marks have been made. 
	In the 2.x Acrobat viewers, the page printing sequence to 
	a PostScript printer is:
	<p><code>page setup (including setpagedevice) ... save ...
	gsave ... save ... begin ... begin ... begin ... PDDocWillPrintPage() ... page
	contents ... PDDocDidPrintPage() ... end ... end ... end ... restore ... restore ...
	showpage.</code></p>

	<p>This sequence must not be relied upon, and it is 
	to some extent dependent on the printer driver in use. Nevertheless, 
	it is <code>true</code> that by the time the PDDocWillPrintPage() notification 
	is broadcast, it is too late to perform any <code>setpagedevice</code> 
	operations. </p>

	@param psLevel When printing to a PostScript printer, 
	<code>psLevel</code> is either <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>, representing the PostScript level 
	available on the printer. When printing to a non-PostScript 
	printer, <code>psLevel</code> is <code>0</code>. <code>psLevel</code> is useful in determining 
	whether the output device is a PostScript printer. In addition, 
	when printing to a PostScript printer, <code>psLevel</code> is useful 
	to determine the operators that can be sent in any printing 
	code downloaded using the <code>PDDocWillPrintDoc()</code>, <code>PDDocWillPrintPage()</code>, 
	and <code>PDDocDidPrintPage()</code> notifications. 
	@param clientData A pointer to a block of user-supplied
