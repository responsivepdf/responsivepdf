/*
** Platform defines
**
** Predefined symbols can be split into three general categories,
** predefined (compiler) hardware specific, Acrobat defined hardware 
** specific, and operating system interface specific (acrobat defined).
** 
**
** Hardware specific defines are predefined by the compiler and 
** include:
**		__i386		Intel 80x86 processors
**		__alpha		Digital 21x64 processors (alpha)
**		__sparc		Sun Sparc compatible processors
**		__mips		Mips (a tiny division of SGI) processors
**
** Acrobat hardware specific defines are defined in this module 
** and use only the predefined hardware defines or each other to
** decide their value.  They should not use the operating system
** symbols.  They include:
**		IEEEFLOAT	Should be true for all high-level processors
**		AS_LITTLEENDIAN	True if most significant byte is in low byte
**		POINTER_64_BITS True if a pointer is represented by 64 bits
**
** Operating system interface specific symbols are defined in the
** system specific makefiles for each platform and include:
**		SOLARIS	
**		LINUX
**		HPUX
**		SGI
**		AIX
**		OSF
**		SUN		(For SunOS not Solaris)
**
** The exception (isn't there always one) is SWAPBITS.  SWAPBITS is an AGM
** thing for the most part and is defined in IntCnfig.h in the AGM world but
** AcroCore filters which came from the PS world also use it.  For simplicities
** sake, SWAPBITS is defined here so that it doesn't have to be put on the
** compiler line with a -D.
**
** Note: SOLARIS is an operating system interface and has nothing necessarily
**       to due hardware since Solaris runs on Sparc and Intel.  Conversely,
**       __alpha does not imply OSF as the operating system since an Alpha
**       can run OSF (Digital Unix), Linux, or NT.
